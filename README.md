## Overview ##
*Heroes of Pymoli*
Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analysing the data for their most recent fantasy game *Heroes of Pymoli*.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

## Three Observable Trends ##

When we analyze the data on the fantasy game “ Heroes of Pymoli”, we can observe three trends. We can analyze the data on 576 players.

Males are the ones who play the most with a percentage of 86% versus 14% for the females. However, female players spend 6% in average more than the male.

Also 3/4 of the players are between 15 and 29 year-olds. The biggest number of players are the 20-24 year-olds. Together, they represent 45% of the population or 258 players. If they are the most present in the population, they are, however, not the one who spend the most money. The 35-39 year-olds are the category who has the highest purchasing power: With $3.60 spent in average, this category of age make almost 20% difference compare to the 15-29 year-olds who represent 77% of the purchasers. The top 5 spenders spent an average of $3.45 per purchase with a total average purchase of $13.32.

Last but not least, three of the four most popular items are also the most profitable. The number one item in each category goes to “Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm”. 12 of them have been sold for a total value of $50.76. Nevertheless, if we divide the total purchase value by the purchase count, the number one item is the “Fiery Glass Crusader” with a ratio of $4.90 per game and the last one is “Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm” with a ratio of $4.23. Then we can explain its highest quantity sold because it is the least expensive.
